## MySQL Business Analysis Project for Expenses and Claims

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how raw and messy data from Excel can be transformed into clear, meaningful insights using **MySQL** and **Excel**. The aim of the analysis was to address the issue of **expenses and claims being processed against the company**, highlighting the biggest offenders and uncovering patterns for future improvements.

By writing and running a series of SQL queries, I was able to structure and interrogate the data to reveal actionable insights. These findings were then visualised through various charts and graphs in Excel to present a compelling business case.

## Business Objectives

The primary goals of this analysis were:

- Identify the **highest offenders** for key variables contributing to claims.
- **Link and pair variables** to reveal the highest offending combinations, offering deeper visibility into the causes of high-value and high-volume claims.
- Present findings visually to support data-driven decision-making.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **MySQL Workbench** – to clean, query, and analyse the data.  
  - Predominantly used: `SELECT`, `COUNT`, `FROM`, `GROUP BY`, and `ORDER BY DESC`.
  - Imported raw data from Excel as CSV files and exported query results back to Excel.
- **Excel** – to create clear and impactful visualisations using pivot tables, charts, and graphs.
- **GitHub** – to host and share the project.

## Analysis Process

1. Imported raw data from Excel into MySQL as CSV files.
2. Wrote and executed a range of SQL queries to:
   - Identify key offenders in each variable category.
   - Combine variables to pinpoint the most significant offending combinations.
3. Exported query results back into Excel.
4. Used Excel pivot tables and chart tools to visualise results for clear presentation and interpretation.

## Visualisations Created

The following visualisations were produced to communicate findings:

- **Pie charts** – to show individual offenders (e.g. petrol type, fuel type, gearbox type).
- **Bar charts** – to compare categories side by side and highlight the biggest contributors.
- **Scatter graphs** – to show combinations of variables (e.g. *petrol type 1* with *fuel type 2* and *gearbox type 1*), providing a deeper understanding of what drives high-value and high-volume claims.

## Key Insights

- Identified the most frequent and costly offenders across multiple variables.
- Revealed combinations of factors that contribute disproportionately to expenses and claims.
- Provided clear data-backed evidence to support future process improvements and decision-making.
